― Nicolas Chamfort
""Durch die Leidenschaften lebt der Mensch, durch die Vernunft existiert er bloss.""

This is my motto  in life and I try to live up to it as much as I can. I have traveled extensively for work and leisure and made invaluable experiences during my trips. I am passionate about wine, food, exotic herbs and plants. But nothing beats good company and great talks! My home is my castle I love and I care about. You are welcome to share and enjoy it with me.

I am an easy going, open minded person with a lot of interests.  I love reading  and I am an ""old school"" newspaper addict. On a Sunday morning you will most likely find me on the sofa surrounded by newspapers and magazines and well equipped with coffee and cookies to indulge in what is going on in the world.

Note to Guests
• I enjoy meeting people and like to know who my guests are. Write a bit about yourself and your purpose of travelling. That way I not only get a better picture of you but can come up with valuable information and ideas to make your arrival and stay pleasent, convenient and memorable.
• A novel of your life story isn't necessary; just write about what you think someone meeting you for the first time would want to know.

PHILOSOPHY
IT’S GONNA BE LEGEN-… WAIT FOR IT… -DARY!

I like Interesting People ... But what make you interesting? I would say if you are different! That can be weird stories you believe, crazy in emotional or lifestyle way, Special things you do or did, cool stories of your live or much more.

Also i like interesting people who are bit different then other people (but be yourself).

But the main think is exchange idea, culture and get new connection.

What i like to talk: 
Aliens, Sexuality, Paranormal things, Traveling, crazy experiments, Quantenphysik, Sport, Agharta, Psychologie, to read your personalty

One of my passion is fotografie. 
About my fotografie work:

I love also Sport and teach functional training:

Some Quotes:
""Unthinking respect for authority is the greatest enemy of truth.""
- Albert Einstein

""Peace cannot be kept by force. It can only be achieved by understanding. You cannot subjugate a nation forcibly unless you wipe out every man, woman, and child. Unless you wish to use such drastic measures, you must find a way of settling your disputes without resort to arms."" 
- Albert Einstein

""All of science is nothing more than the refinement of everyday thinking.""
- Albert Einstein

""Now he has departed from this strange world a little ahead of me. That means nothing. People like us, who believe in physics, know that the distinction between past, present, and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion.""
- Albert Einstein

""We cannot expect to cross the rainbow bridge through a good act of contrition; that will not be sufficient. We have to understand."" - Terrence McKenna

""Hastiness and superficiality are the psychic diseases of the twentieth century, and more than anywhere else this illness is reflected in the press."" - Alexandr Solzhenitsyn

""My ultimate dream is to sow seeds in the desert. To revegetate the deserts is to sow seed in people's hearts."" - Masanobu Fukuoka

""Men tend to have the beliefs that suit their passions. Cruel men believe in a cruel God, and use their belief to excuse their cruelty. Only kindly men believe in a kindly God, and they would be kindly in any case."" - Bertrand Russell

""Live as if you were living for the second time and had acted as wrongly the first time as you are about to act now."" - Viktor Frankl

""The sick individual finds himself at home with all other similarly sick individuals. The whole culture is geared to this kind of pathology. The result is that the average individual does not experience the separateness and isolation the fully schizophrenic person feels. He feels at ease among those who suffer from the same deformation; in fact, it is the fully sane person who feels isolated in the insane society — and he may suffer so much from the incapacity to communicate that it is he who may become psychotic. In the context of this study the crucial question is whether the hypothesis of a quasi-autistic or of low-grade schizophrenic disturbance would help us to explain some of the violence spreading today."" - Erich Fromm

""World War III is a guerrilla information war with no division between military and civilian participation."" - Marshall Mcluhan

""Reason is a harmonising, controlling force rather than a creative one. Even in the most purely logical realms, it is insight that first arrives at what is new."" 
- Bertrand Russell

Don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened.

Some Quotes:
""Unthinking respect for authority is the greatest enemy of truth.""
- Albert Einstein

""Peace cannot be kept by force. It can only be achieved by understanding. You cannot subjugate a nation forcibly unless you wipe out every man, woman, and child. Unless you wish to use such drastic measures, you must find a way of settling your disputes without resort to arms."" 
- Albert Einstein

""All of science is nothing more than the refinement of everyday thinking.""
- Albert Einstein

""Now he has departed from this strange world a little ahead of me. That means nothing. People like us, who believe in physics, know that the distinction between past, present, and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion.""
- Albert Einstein

""We cannot expect to cross the rainbow bridge through a good act of contrition; that will not be sufficient. We have to understand."" - Terrence McKenna

""Hastiness and superficiality are the psychic diseases of the twentieth century, and more than anywhere else this illness is reflected in the press."" - Alexandr Solzhenitsyn

""My ultimate dream is to sow seeds in the desert. To revegetate the deserts is to sow seed in people's hearts."" - Masanobu Fukuoka

""Men tend to have the beliefs that suit their passions. Cruel men believe in a cruel God, and use their belief to excuse their cruelty. Only kindly men believe in a kindly God, and they would be kindly in any case."" - Bertrand Russell

""Live as if you were living for the second time and had acted as wrongly the first time as you are about to act now."" - Viktor Frankl

""The sick individual finds himself at home with all other similarly sick individuals. The whole culture is geared to this kind of pathology. The result is that the average individual does not experience the separateness and isolation the fully schizophrenic person feels. He feels at ease among those who suffer from the same deformation; in fact, it is the fully sane person who feels isolated in the insane society — and he may suffer so much from the incapacity to communicate that it is he who may become psychotic. In the context of this study the crucial question is whether the hypothesis of a quasi-autistic or of low-grade schizophrenic disturbance would help us to explain some of the violence spreading today."" - Erich Fromm

""World War III is a guerrilla information war with no division between military and civilian participation."" - Marshall Mcluhan

""Reason is a harmonising, controlling force rather than a creative one. Even in the most purely logical realms, it is insight that first arrives at what is new."" 
- Bertrand Russell

Don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened.

― Nicolas Chamfort
""Durch die Leidenschaften lebt der Mensch, durch die Vernunft existiert er bloss.""

This is my motto  in life and I try to live up to it as much as I can. I have traveled extensively for work and leisure and made invaluable experiences during my trips. I am passionate about wine, food, exotic herbs and plants. But nothing beats good company and great talks! My home is my castle I love and I care about. You are welcome to share and enjoy it with me.

I am an easy going, open minded person with a lot of interests.  I love reading  and I am an ""old school"" newspaper addict. On a Sunday morning you will most likely find me on the sofa surrounded by newspapers and magazines and well equipped with coffee and cookies to indulge in what is going on in the world.

Note to Guests
• I enjoy meeting people and like to know who my guests are. Write a bit about yourself and your purpose of travelling. That way I not only get a better picture of you but can come up with valuable information and ideas to make your arrival and stay pleasent, convenient and memorable.
• A novel of your life story isn't necessary; just write about what you think someone meeting you for the first time would want to know.

I revel in the diverse cuisine offered by the restaurants rig",https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/2463e613-eed5-4b7d-8024-63a6aa506456.jpg,16301607,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/16301607,Sima,2014-06-02,"Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland","English:

I live right in the heart of Zurich, just behind the Tonhalle concert hall and only a few steps away from Lake Zurich, the Old Town, the Schauspielhaus theater and the Opera. That means I'm directly adjacent to Zurich's business center at Paradeplatz, where the famous Sprüngli Cafe is also located. The area reflects my personality in many ways. As an actress who's engaged mainly in film and television and as a dance instructor at the Zurich University of the Arts, I love being surrounded by culture and business institutions, with the ability to step outside my spacious, 170m2 apartment whenever I feel like it, whether for a stroll in the city center or to go to the cinema, theater, or opera. When the weather is nice, I often take a boat from the harbor at Bürkliplatz - practically right outside my front door - and go down the lake to Rapperswil, or else I lie out on one of the beautiful beaches along Lake Zurich, all of them within walking distance of my apartment. If I want a bit of green, to lose myself in one of my books, I take a short walk along the Schanzengraben canal, which runs right past my apartment, and find a spot to sit in the old Botanical Garden, located on a hill where you can look out over the rooftops of the city and enjoy a wonderful view of the Alps. Of course I also love to ride my bike to the neighboring Districts 4 and 5, which are enlivened by cosmopolitan art galleries and where the night life never seems to take a break with its countless clubs and open air festivals. And if I want to get into a bit of a Medieval mood, I walk to the Old Town with its Lindenplatz square and all the quaint cafes and boutiques, where I can enjoy life to the fullest. Zurich is a beautiful city that I appreciate more and more every day.


As the daughter of an American mother and an Iranian father, I am very open-minded and travel as much as I can to discover more about the world we live in. As my apartment has a very generous floorplan and is situated in the best possible location in the city, I would like to host nice people from all around the world. 
The apartment has 6 large, spacious rooms, 2 bathrooms, a brand-new, large, high-end kitchen with a dishwasher, and there's also a washer and dryer in the basement that can be used at any time. 
I also run in two of the spacious rooms a professional Pilates Studio with complete equipment, so if you are interested to book a privat- or semi privat Pilates class, or join one of the groups of maximum 4 people you are very welcome to do so! 
You find the Pilates studio under the name ""Body Line Pilates"" in Zurich City, where you also just can book a session also by the online booking system, Bookly!

Finally, as to my philosophy of life, I am a Buddhist and I strive for peace in the world.

Deutsch:

Ich wohne inmitten des Zentrums von Zürich, direkt hinter der Tonhalle, zu Fuss nur wenige Schritte zum Zürichsee, zur Altstadt, zum Schauspielhaus und zur Oper. Natürlich befinde ich mit somit auch inmitten des Wirtschaftszentrums von Zürich, direkt am Paradeplatz, wo sich auch das berühmte Sprünglicafé befindet. Diese Umgebung widerspiegelt in vieler Hinsicht meine Persönlichkeit. Als Schauspielerin vorwiegend beim Film und Fernsehen tätig und als Tanzpädagogin an der Zürcher Hochschule der Künste (ZHdK) angestellt, liebe ich es inmitten der Kultur und Wirtschaft zu leben, nach Lust und Laune meine grosszügige 170 m2 Wohnung zu verlassen, und spontan im Stadtzentrum bummeln zu gehen, oder mich ins Kino, Theater oder in die Oper zu begeben. Bei schönem Wetter nehme ich am Hafen beim Bürkliplatz des öfteren auch das Schiff, direkt sozusagen vor meiner Haustür, und fahre den Zürisee hinunter bis nach Rapperswil, oder ich lege mich an einen der schönen Strände am Zürichsee, welche allesamt zu Fuss von meiner Wohnung erreichbar sind. Möchte ich ins Grüne, um in meinen Büchern zu schmökern, laufe ich kurz dem Schanzengraben, einem kleinen Fluss, direkt bei meiner Wohnung, entlang, und setze mich in den alten botanischen Garten, welcher sich auf einem Hügel befindet, so dass man von dort über die Häuser der Stadt schauen und einen wunderschönen Blick in die Alpen geniessen kann. Natürlich fahre ich auch gerne Velo (Fahrrad), um auch in die anliegenden Kreise 4 und 5 zu gelangen, welche von urbanen Kunstgalerien belebt sind und das Nachtleben mit seinen unzähligen Klubs und Open Air Feste nie zur Ruhe zu kommen scheint. Und möchte ich mich ein wenig wie im Mittelalter fühlen, gehe ich zu Fuss in die Altstadt, auf den Lindenplatz, in die vielen kleinen Cafés und Boutiquen und geniesse das Leben in vollen Zügen. Zürich ist eine wunderschöne Stadt, die ich von Tag zu Tag mehr zu schätzen weiss.
Als Tochter einer amerikanischen Mutter und eines iranischen Vaters bin ich sehr weltoffen und reise so viel ich kann, um noch mehr von unserem Planeten zu entdecken.  
Da meine Wohnung sehr grosszügig geschnitten ist und sich in bester Lage der Stadt befindet, würde ich mich freuen, wenn ich hier Gäste aus aller Welt beherbergen darf.  Diese Begegnungen geben mir das Gefühlt, dass ich selber auf Reisen bin! 
Die Wohnung hat 6 grosse und stattliche Zimmer, zwei Badezimmer (2 WC), eine neue grosse und sehr edle Küche mit Geschirrspüler und im Keller befindet sich auch eine Waschmaschine und Trockner, die man zu jeder Zeit benützen darf. 
In derselben Wohnung, welche 170 m2 umfasst, befinden sich zudem zwei Studioräume in denen ich Pilates an den Geräten für private- und halbprivate Kunden, sowie für kleine Gruppen von maximal 4 Personen unterrichte. Gerne kann man sich somit auch bei mir vor Ort für Pilates anmelden oder direkt über das online Buchungssystem Bookly des Studios ""Body Line Pilates"" einzelne Lektionen in Pilates buchen.
Ja und von meiner Lebensphilosophie bin ich Buddhistin und bemühe mich für den Weltfrieden.

About the room: 
- Simply furnished (mattress, space for clothes, desk, and chair)
- Separate bathroom with shower and toilet
- Shared facilities include the living room, kitchen and balcony. 

Public transportation to the city center is convenient and includes a train (15 min to main train station via train S6) as well as multiple bus lines (approx. 25 min to city center). Also, for those who enjoy nature, there is plenty of fields, forests and lakes close by for you to go jogging, walking or for a summer swim.

― Nicolas Chamfort
""Durch die Leidenschaften lebt der Mensch, durch die Vernunft existiert er bloss.""

This is my motto  in life and I try to live up to it as much as I can. I have traveled extensively for work and leisure and made invaluable experiences during my trips. I am passionate about wine, food, exotic herbs and plants. But nothing beats good company and great talks! My home is my castle I love and I care about. You are welcome to share and enjoy it with me.

I am an easy going, open minded person with a lot of interests.  I love reading  and I am an ""old school"" newspaper addict. On a Sunday morning you will most likely find me on the sofa surrounded by newspapers and magazines and well equipped with coffee and cookies to indulge in what is going on in the world.

Note to Guests
• I enjoy meeting people and like to know who my guests are. Write a bit about yourself and your purpose of travelling. That way I not only get a better picture of you but can come up with valuable information and ideas to make your arrival and stay pleasent, convenient and memorable.
• A novel of your life story isn't necessary; just write about what you think someone meeting you for the first time would want to know.

― Nicolas Chamfort
""Durch die Leidenschaften lebt der Mensch, durch die Vernunft existiert er bloss.""

This is my motto  in life and I try to live up to it as much as I can. I have traveled extensively for work and leisure and made invaluable experiences during my trips. I am passionate about wine, food, exotic herbs and plants. But nothing beats good company and great talks! My home is my castle I love and I care about. You are welcome to share and enjoy it with me.

I am an easy going, open minded person with a lot of interests.  I love reading  and I am an ""old school"" newspaper addict. On a Sunday morning you will most likely find me on the sofa surrounded by newspapers and magazines and well equipped with coffee and cookies to indulge in what is going on in the world.

Note to Guests
• I enjoy meeting people and like to know who my guests are. Write a bit about yourself and your purpose of travelling. That way I not only get a better picture of you but can come up with valuable information and ideas to make your arrival and stay pleasent, convenient and memorable.
• A novel of your life story isn't necessary; just write about what you think someone meeting you for the first time would want to know.

Vor diesem Hintergrund wurde 2011 die Gemeinnützige Baugenossenschaft InVia (unterwegs)  gegründet. In den folgenden Jahren wurde eine passende Liegenschaften gesucht und schliesslich war es möglich, am Neeserweg 10 in Zürich, einen Neubau zu erstellen. Im November 2018 bezogen wir unsere Wohnungen. In unserer Genossenschaft haben Menschen in verschiedenen Lebenslagen Platz.

A few years ago people of different Christian denominations came up with the idea (some would call it a vision) to shape our lives after fifty, i.e. age 50+, together. In the light of this dream the non-profit cooperative building association ""InVia"" (=on the way) was founded in 2011. In the following years we looked for a suitable piece of property and we finally found one on Neeserweg in Zurich.
In November 2018 we were able to move into the apartments).
In our cooperative association there is room for different life conceptions. Our core group finds its basic values, inspiration and strength from Christian faith, lived both personally and communally. People are welcome as members as long as they respect this brand of spirituality, but they do not necessarily have to share it. We have planned a studio in the house, so that we can receive both our own and foreign guests.

Il y a quelque temps, des membres de différents courants chrétiens à Zürich ont eu la vision de former ensemble leur période de vie après l’âge de cinquante ans (50+). Sur cette trame la coopérative de construction d’utilité publique à but non lucratif «InVia » (= en bonne voie) fut fondée en 2011. Dans les années suivantes nous avons cherché un bien foncier convenable et nous l’avons trouvé au Neeserweg à Zürich, où finalement l’immeuble  finit par être construit. En 2018 il nous fut possible de nous installer dans les différents appartements. Dans notre société coopérative il y a de la place pour différents styles de vie.

It is a very exciting city to be in as it has a lot to offer. I like to travel, food and sports. My hobby are cars and watches. 

I am a very welcoming host, I like to meet my guests and make sure they are confortable and most importantly I do like to make my guests feel they are at home. 

As a host on Airbnb and traveller I have learned the beauty of hosting people from different parts of the world and provide them with excellent services and very comfortable stay. 

My promise to my guests is: YOU will always have a friend and a good assistant in me if you ever need while you are in New York and after you leave . 

I would like to tell my guest you are welcome to your home away from home. 

Hosting is what I do best, I offer comfort and relaxation, to all our guests and I like to say I have met so many wonderful people during my years of hosting and I am always looking forward to meet more wonderful people and get the pleasure of hosting them.

Favorite continent to travel: Asia
Favorite country to live: Italy (but I LOVE Switzerland and especially Zurich where I currently live)
Favorite fruit: mango, but I go crazy about all what is in season. 

You will have a positive, vibrant and bubbly world citizen as host/guest with a lot of travel and life stories to tell (in lots of languages).

Vor ein paar Jahren hat Lukas in einem Bubble Hotel in La Réunion übernachtet und war vom Erlebnis begeistert. Er hat dann zusammen mit Iwan an der Umsetzung eines solchen Projekts in der Region Zürich gearbeitet. Die beiden haben einen Weg gefunden, wie man ein Angebot gestalten könnte, waren nach erstem Standort-Misserfolg nur noch auf der Suche nach einem geeignetem Plätzchen. Durch einen glücklichen Zufall sind sie dann auf Corinne aufmerksam geworden, welche nicht nur einen wunderschönen Standort zu bieten hatte, sondern mit ihren Fähigkeiten das Team perfekt ergänzen konnte. Seit dem hat das Dreierteam daran gearbeitet, den Leuten eine unvergessliche Übernachtungsmöglichkeit zu bieten, welche gerade im Sommer 2020, wegen den vielen gescheiterten Urlaubsplänen, gerne gebucht wird.


Über uns
Iwan und Lukas haben sich während dem Studium kennengelernt und durch viele lustige gemeinsame Abende, abenteuerliche Reisen und interessante Projekte eine enge Freundschaft entwickelt. Corinne unterrichtet Yoga und leitet mit Freundinnen verschiedene Workshops wie Hypno-Yoga und Woodland Medicine.

And here is our story...

As an IT professional with global experience and the first ever  real estate entrepreneur in Switzerland with ´empathy´ for our guests, I take pride in keeping the Indian tradition of valuing our guests as ´God´ - अतिथि देवो भवः (Atithi Devo Bhava) as we say in Sanskrit. It is our endeavour  to offer you a truly  ‘home-away-from-home’ experience, a feeling as someone rightly said. 

“Home is not a place…it’s a feeling.”

I am a Swiss resident of Indian origin and speak English, German and Hindi. I believe in the philosophy ´the world is one family - वसुधैव कुटुम्बकम्  (Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam) and ´the global village´. 

It´s my privilege and honor to welcome you from all over the world. I look forward to welcome you in my ´signature´ and beautifully done ´Swiss Home´.

You are welcome to choose from one of the 60 apartments all over Switzerland in all the different ´flavours´ - studio, sharing, holiday apartments, ladies only, sharing, full occupancy and even on daily and weekly basis.

We have apartments in - Bern, Basel, Zug, Zurich, Winterthur, Luzern, Adliswil, Glattbrugg, Bonstetten and we are still growing well...

I am the only real estate entrepreneur in Switzerland who gives you a ´home´. instead of an apartment and who connects you with ´community´ instead of just getting ´networked´ !

And we have a special offer for corporate travellers for long or short term stay in Switzerland.

Our beautifully done signature apartments all over Switzerland  ensure true feelings and warmth of ´home away´from home, a Swiss home with local ´flavour´!

Come, please enjoy our hospitality and spread the word around...

I was born in Zurich, studied economics in Berlin and Dubai and am now back in Zurich were I am running a company in the real estate business.  

I like doing sports like tennis, sailing, volley etc but enjoy going out in Zurichs nightlife as well. I would describe myself as very open and spontaneous and love showing people what the city has to offer. 

As son of a family working mainly in the tourism branch i had many chances to visit many countries in the world and get to know a lot of different cultures which i think is very interesting and helpful in life. The good side effect is, that I enjoy showing guest around in Zurich and ""share"" what our City offers! 

Having into depth discussions suit me as much as going out and having fun.

I like doing sports like tennis, sailing, volley etc but enjoy going out in Zurichs nightlife as well. I would describe myself as very open and spontaneous and love showing people what the city has to offer. 

As son of a family working mainly in the tourism branch i had many chances to visit many countries in the world and get to know a lot of different cultures which i think is very interesting and helpful in life. The good side effect is, that I enjoy showing guest around in Zurich and ""share"" what our City offers! 

Having into depth discussions suit me as much as going out and having fun.
